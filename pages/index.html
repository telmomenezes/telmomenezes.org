    <h2>Knowledge Hypergraphs</h2>

    <p>Hypergraphs are a generalization of graphs (mathematical objects that represent networks), that allow for the representation of complex information structures, namely human knowledge and natural language communication. By employing modern Natural Language Processing techniques and general knowledge ontologies and databases, it becomes possible to transform free-form text into formal structures that are convenient both for AI and Social Sciences research.</p>
    <p>The GraphBrain open-source research tool is being developed with the aim of both aiding in the research project, and making the techniques available to the scientific community.</p>

    <h2>Network Generators and Artificial Scientists</h2>

    <p>Models explaining network morphology and growth processes permit a wide range of phenomena to be more systematically analyzed and understood. At the same time, creating such models is often challenging and requires insights that may be counter-intuitive. We have developed an approach to automatically detect realistic decentralized network growth models from empirical data, employing a machine learning technique inspired by natural selection and defining a unified formalism to describe such models as computer programs. The proposed method can be applied “out of the box” to any given network. We were able to find programs that are simple enough to lead to an actual understanding of underlaying mechanisms, namely for a simple brain and a social network.</p>

    <h2>Scales of Human Movement</h2>
    <img src="images/natural_scales.jpg" alt="Scales of Human Movement" class="img-fluid">
    <p>Human mobility is known to be distributed across several orders of magnitude of physical distances, which makes it difficult to find or define typical and meaningful scales. Relying on geotagged data collected from photo-sharing social media, we apply community detection to movement networks constrained by increasing percentiles of the distance distribution. We discover clear phase transitions in the community partition space. This is the first known method of identifying natural scales of human movement. The partitions of the natural scales allow us to draw discrete multi-scale geographical boundaries, potentially capable of providing key insights in fields such as epidemiology or cultural contagion.</p>
